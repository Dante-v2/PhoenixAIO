# **Sneaker Bot - Archived Project**
This is the first project I ever worked on.

*I created a new repository because the previous one contained sensitive data.*

## **About the Project**
- Developed between **May and September 2020.**
- An **All-In-One bot** designed to help sneaker resellers purchase sneakers faster on various websites.
- The last update was about **three years ago**.
- During our peak we had around *300 paying members*.

I decided to publish it now because the sneaker market has changed significantly it's either dead or not what it used to be in the good old days.

## How It Worked  

The bot operated based on user inputs provided in **task.csv** files.  
From these files, it extracted the necessary information to monitor and attempt to purchase the desired product.  

The entire process was **fully automated** and optimized for maximum speed, as these items would sell out almost instantly due to high demand and competition from other buyers.  

## **Status**
The bot is **not functional** as it requires a license key to run. Since the dashboard has been shut down, you canâ€™t use it as it is.

If you remove all security checks in ```main.py```, you might be able to get it running, but it's unlikely that any of the modules still work. Websites update frequently, and some stores have shut down.
